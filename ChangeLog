2013-03-04 15:57  jjs@gcu.ac.uk

	* [r709] PLUGINS, ACTIONS & FILTERS: This code allows you to add a
	  'plugin' in the /plugins folder which will augment functionality
	  provided by XOT. It allows you to create single file or folder
	  style plugins (similar to Wordpress) which add functionality to
	  various 'hook' points within the page. These hooks are by no
	  means definitive and hopefully we can add lots more, however for
	  filters to work in a better way some code will need re-written in
	  order to pass 'content' through the filter before being used or
	  echo-ed..
	  
	  The current files should do nothing to an install. The example
	  plugins are commented out - remove the 'REMOVE_THIS' text from
	  the filenames in order to activate. The 'GCU Plugin' demonstrates
	  some potentially useful functionality:
	  
	  It adds a banner at the top of the page (login and editor)
	  It changes the <title> text
	  It changes the "My Projects" text to "John's Projects"
	  It adds text to Pod 1
	  It adds a title slide to data.xml on save
	  
	  The plugin_one plugin simply inserts HTML comments at action hook
	  points throughout the page. Enable this by taking out REMOVE_THIS
	  and then refresh the page and view the source to reveal it's
	  result...

2013-03-04 09:58  ajjreijnders@gmail.com

	* [r643] remove pointless validation code from js - this does not
	  protect from sql injection

2013-01-25 15:20  ajjreijnders@gmail.com

	* [r642] 1. Added an optional parameter visuals (Flash Engine
	  Visuals) for the learningObject in data.xwd. This is exactly the
	  same as the visuals of IFC (in standalone Xerte). It enables to
	  have a white default player without the accessibility buttons. I
	  still need to implement a way to get those back by a key press.
	  It makes the LO easier for children with ADD or ADHD. The visuals
	  of the learningObject has priority over the visuals of IFC. It
	  doesn't have any effect on the HTML5 code.
	  
	  2. Added a parameter language (Language) to the learningObject in
	  data.xwd. The parameter itself was already in, but you could not
	  edit it.
	  
	  3. Changed code, so that the language parameter of learningObject
	  has precedence over the language of LO. This is a change that
	  should be checked in HTML5.
	  
	  4. Modified the language selection code of XOT (it now uses the
	  language-config.xml file to present the available options, and it
	  is available in the workspace, so now you can change languages
	  even if you use some kind of integration or guest access. (It
	  used to available on the login page only)
	  
	  5. Added a 'LanguageList'type in the wizard. It presents a
	  combobox populated with the languages in language-config.xml.
	  This is used in 2.
	  
	  6. Changed the wizard so that the popup messages can be
	  translated as well.

	* [r553] extracted the commented authentication options from
	  config.php and added to a required file named auth_config.php.
	  This means when updating/upgrading config.php can be overwritten
	  without changing the authentication method back to Guest. When
	  updating/upgrading auth_config.php should be excluded or
	  re-edited after update. Updated the moodle_integration_readme.txt
	  instructions to reflect this change.

	  but the latter needs additions to .htaccess

	  integration. The code to restrict moodle guest access is enabled
	  if moodle authentication is chosen. The custom profile field code
	  is commented out but there for reference for those who want to
	  use it. Might be better to make both of these a function inside
	  \library\Xerte\Authentication\Moodle.php and just call from
	  config.php but not sure?
